## Study on the Novel Coronavirus in Python

### Resources
- SARS-CoV-2 Genom is made public for researcher and scientists to collaborate. There are many genomes available, but in this study the genome was collected from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_045512 

### SARS
- SARS-CoV-2 is the new ccoronavirus that has led to worst pandemic in recent history. Many researchers are trying to find vaccine and other possible sure for this virus. Previously SARS Coronavirus was deteted which had almost same sysmtoms
- SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Sydrome) Coronavirus infects the epithilial cells within the lungs. Epithilial tissues line the outer surfaces of organs and blood vessels throght the boody and also inner surfaces of many cavities
- SARS virus enters the body through ACE2 receptors and the symptoms are muscle pain, head ache, fever followed in 2-14 days and respiratory problems mainly cough, dyspnea (shortness of breath) and pnuemonia.
- Pnuemonia is a inflamation condition of lungs which primarily effect the alvioli. 

### SARS-CoV-2
- Genome size of Coronaviruses is one of the largest among RNA Viruses. Its about 17- 34 Kilobases (1 Kilobases = 1000 base pairs) 
- SARS-Cov2 is approximately 50-200 nm in diameter. SARS-Cov-2 like other coronaviruses it has four protiens, Spike (S), Envelope (E), Membrane (M), Nucleocapsid (N), The N protein holds the RNA Genome while the S, M and E protein together create the Viral Envelope
- Viral envelope is the outer layer of many viruses including SARS-CoV-2. The lipid bilayer envelope of these viruses are sensitive to heat, dryness, detergent. Hence Washing hands with soap will kill the virus
- the Spike (S) protein is responisble for alowing the virus to be attach and fuse with the membrane of the host cell. Initial spike protein priming by transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for entry of SARS-CoV-2. After a SARS-CoV-2 virion attaches to a target cell, the cell's protease TMPRSS2 cuts open the spike protein of the virus, exposing a fusion peptide. The virion then releases RNA into the cell, forcing the cell to produce copies of the virus that are disseminated to infect more cells
